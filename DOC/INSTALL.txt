<<Build, Installation, and tests of SPBR (short version)>>
 
 * For details, see README.txt
 *  Below '$' means the command prompt.

(1) How to build SPBR
 First, edit INSTALL_DIR in Makefile, if necessary.
 The default setting is as follows:
 INSTALL_DIR=$(HOME)/local/bin

 Then execute the followings: 

    $ sh config_spbr.sh
    $ make clean 
    $ make 
    ($ rehash)

    Note: "rehash" is not supported in Bone Shell.
          Restart your command terminal,
	  if you are using Bone Shell

(2) How to install SPBR

    $ make install

    Note: This copies the built executable files,
           "spbr" and "opbr", into the directory
	   by "INSTALL_DIR" (see (1) above). 

    Note: (1) + (2) is equivalent to the following:
      $ sh config_spbr.sh
      $ make autoinstall

(3) How to test SPBR
  Transparent visualization (spbr):
    $ make test1 //SPBR-ACII data
    $ make test2 //PLY-ACII data
    $ make test5 //SPBR-binary data
    $ make test6 //PLY-binary data

  Opaque visualization (opbr):
    $ make test3 //SPBR-ACII data
    $ make test4 //PLY-ACII data
    $ make test7 //SPBR-binary data
    $ make test8 //PLY-binary data
